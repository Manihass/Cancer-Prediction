## Introduction

Cancer is a significant health concern worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of cancer can greatly improve patient outcomes. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of cancer based on various patient attributes and diagnostic measures.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

1. **Sample code number**: A unique identifier for each sample.
2. **Clump Thickness**: Thickness of the clump.
3. **Uniformity of Cell Size**: Uniformity of cell size.
4. **Uniformity of Cell Shape**: Uniformity of cell shape.
5. **Marginal Adhesion**: Level of marginal adhesion.
6. **Single Epithelial Cell Size**: Size of single epithelial cell.
7. **Bare Nuclei**: Presence of bare nuclei.
8. **Bland Chromatin**: Chromatin condition.
9. **Normal Nucleoli**: Normal nucleoli count.
10. **Mitoses**: Number of mitoses.
11. **Class**: Diagnosis class (1 for malignant, 0 for benign).
